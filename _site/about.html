        <section id="main_content"> 
        <p> Hi. I'm June Ahn. I started this site in January 2015 as a side project to: (a) Teach myself how to use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>; and (b) Write about analytics and NBA basketball. </p>
        <p>In my day job I'm a researcher with a PhD in Urban Education. I have training in applied statistics and I do research about how to improve education and learning with technology. I'm also building my skills in data mining techniques on the side. Outside of that, sports fandom is my passion. I grew up in New England so I'm usually rooting for the home teams: Red Sox, Patriots, and Celtics. </p>
        <p>With the increasing availability of data and analytics to inform sports, I wanted to dip a little into this area as a hobby. I hope to show how a little bit of data analysis can give the everyday fan a bit more insight into different aspects of the NBA. I know I'll learn more as I go as well.</p>
        <p>Come back periodically. I'll probably write about once every 3-4 weeks.</p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
